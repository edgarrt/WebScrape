# WebScrape
Wanted to create own database of recipesâ€¦
Searches a website's page for targeted elements and extracts
information, then saves information received into an object then writes object into an Excel Book and if
recipe has picture uses TinifyJPG to shrink the picture and saves it to
a folder.
